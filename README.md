# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

## Requireements

You need only have Python 3 installed on your computer!

## Setup

To open the movie trailer website, clone the repository and open the `fresh_tomatoes.html` file in your favorite web browser. 

Although we have already generated the `fresh_tomatoes.html` file for you, if you'd like to generate it yourself, you need only execute the `entertainment_center.py` file:
```
python3 entertainment_center.py
```
